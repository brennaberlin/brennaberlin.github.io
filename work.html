<p><b>Our mission</b>
    <p>The American health insurance industry is complex, proving to be confusing to a wide range of its users. Cigna prompted us to consider how their user may be better served, primarily by considering how they could shift their service to a whole healthcare experience and lifestyle-centric model, away from the existing fee for service model.</p> 

<b>My role</b>
    <p>Contextual research, stakeholder mapping, user research, analysis, synthesis, concept framework, and concept development.</p>

<b>Key takeaways</b>
    <p>Insights framework, design principles, thinking outside the five points of interaction, concepts, and implementation roadmap.</p>
